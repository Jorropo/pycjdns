# pycjdns

This project is a non official python3 fully async implementation of [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns).

This implementation isn't a good choice for your project, you should stay up date with the real repo, perf and security is better.

This version is just if you need to import cjdns router (and not just the admin panel) and mostly a playground for me (not in main branch :) ).

## Documentation

You can find the doc in [doc/](doc/) and very import the original [whitepaper](doc/Whitepaper.md)

## License

GPL-3.0, find it in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
